Delta Air lines,"""did their jobs with passion""","   I had a heartbreaking day on my departure day. So when I was checking in at Delta, I was crying…( actually more like bawling). Well I wasn't at first, but when Ms Carol asked me how was my day, tears just fell and couldn’t stop it…felt heavy…so I really appreciate that question a lot, she gave me some small talk, which made me open up a bit and that’s when I started crying. She didn’t have to continue comforting me, but she did and I felt it in my heart. Ms Ammi saw me crying and offered me some juice and orange, and a Chocolate cupcake and also comforted me despite how busy they were. They are the best strangers I’ve encountered at that moment too, for the longest time, and that made me feel way lighter. So I think it’s not about the place, or the airline, it’s the people that works within - a truly unforgettable experience even though that was a month ago. I am talking about the Ground staff of Delta Airlines in Baltimore Airport! They did their jobs with passion and understanding, and I salute them all…",Negative

Both had the pink tag indicating a gate checked item. We get to Columbus on our direct flight only to find our stroller with no car seat. Somehow they found a way to send one of our gate checked items on the plane and the other on a plane to LAX. How you even do that is bewildering to me. Then we go to Delta’s customer service counter in Columbus only to be greeted with rudeness and zero apology from the workers. They treated us as if it was our fault the car seat wasn’t there. My wife and I even tried to be nice since we knew it wasn’t them who didn’t put the car seat on the wrong plane. Then they are supposed to offer a temporary replacement car seat until they can get the proper one to us because of situations very similar to ours. all they had were large car seats way too big for our 3 month baby. It would not have been legal to put her in one of those. When we explained that they basically just said “well that sucks”. I had to leave my daughter and wife at the airport and drive 40 minutes to a friend’s house to borrow their car seat and then 40 minutes back. It was well past midnight when I got back to my family. All the meanwhile we received no apology. Horrible experience with Delta. ,Negative

However, the communication on the available options couldn't have been worse. One cabin crew said we could offboard and come back, another said the opposite. When redirected to a manager, I have been told that we would deplane all deplane shortly. Less than two minutes later, another cabin crew announced that we'd be done in 15 minutes. And so on and so forth for 3.5 hours now. One cabin crew in particular has been quite rude when asked for clarifications. He patronizingly retorted that maybe I shouldn't get off the plane if I'm concerned about being able to get back on. How would anyone not be concerned given the circumstances?!

The meager legroom should be an embarrassment to Delta. It is literally impossible for the window seater to get to the aisle without the aisle sitter getting up.When the seat in front is reclined minimally there is not an inch to spare and the screen is hard to see.

When my flight was finally ready for boarding (4 hours after expected time), I tried to scan my physical boarding pass and was told I could not board the flight. I figured this was just because I switched flights in the app, so I showed them my boarding pass in the app. They said I did not have an eticket (despite my app showing my itinerary) and that I would not be allowed to board. I asked to speak to a manager, and she told me since I didn't have an eticket I would not be on the flight, nor could I transfer to another flight or receive a refund. I showed them my original boarding pass, my flight receipt, my app boarding pass, my app itinerary, and my baggage status (showing my bags were on that flight) in the app. They let me watch my flight take off without me. I was able to book a flight with United later in the day and that flight went smoothly.

The flight attendant said the plane was out of balance. This was after 1 1/2 hours into the flight. Then we were put on the Skybridge while the problems, more than just the weight distribution were fixed. One point to consider was I had a 7 hour layover in Seoul.

The seating was pretty good; even though it was Economy Class, I was sitting in Economy Plus, the same seating as Economy Class but with more legroom. The cabin crew were all friendly people, even though we had moderate turbulence that made everyone anxious. However, my only issue is that the food did not meet today's standard for Economy Class. The entree portion was too small, and they didn't notify the mobile app for a last-minute change. I thought I would have a chicken entree because I had reviewed it via United's mobile app. But instead, when I was onboard, I had beef, which confused me.

Both crews were pleasant and accommodating. The main downfall was the food. The menus were uninspired and the presentation was subpar for a business class service. The taste was ok but compared to the competition, they fell well below the mark. For instance, the breakfast had a bowl of cut up fruit that was less interesting that what I make at home. We were fed but with little originality or style. If they could improve this offering, they would truly rate with some of the best. Too bad.",Negative

I purchased the upgrade with cash instead. I called when I landed and the agent assured me it would take 7 to 10 business days to process the refund but to send an email to customer service with information he provided and to call back in 48 hours to ask them to expedite it. I emailed in the information and patiently waited the 7 to 10 business days. At 10 days I had not received the refund so I called the airline and was told they had no idea and had no record about the refund request. They said they'd refer it to their refund department and I'd receive a call the next day. I did not receive a call. I called back the next business day and explained the entire situation to customer service again since there was no record of the call. They told me that it was not refundable. I protested. They escalated the call and put me on hold. 36 minutes into the call another agent answered the call who had no idea what was happening and so I explained it all over again.

They claimed weather as an excuse but there was no weather they had just tried to out-guess it and got it wrong. So I had to pay for a room, my bag again the next day because it couldn't be transferred, an extra day of parking and an extra day of care for my pet - $309! No customer service.

Apparently, the system didn’t recognize that we were only transiting in India and needed us to submit a visa for India which is not needed for transit. The agents specifically told us that it’s good that we didn’t bring checked luggage because we cannot leave the transit area. The agents at the gate forced us to give up the luggage under the premise that we would receive them directly when we exit the plane. There was lots of space on the plane to put carry-on luggage. Upon arrival, of course, our luggage was not there and the New Delhi staff told us we needed to pick up the luggage at the belt. So now, we can‘t receive the luggage and have been stuck at the airport for 2h at this point and missed our connecting flight while they‘re trying to figure out the situation.

american Airlines,"""no desire to fly with them again""","   My wife and I had a 1-stop flight from DFW to St Thomas, with a connecting flight out of Miami. Both flights, DFW to Miami and Miami to St Thomas were through American Airlines. Out flight from DFW to Miami was delayed by 2 hours due to mechanical failure, and all passengers were put on a different plane. The new flight landed in Miami 10 minutes before our connecting flight (Miami to St Thomas) took off, but American couldn't delay their flight 5 minutes to allow 9 passengers to make the last connecting flight out of St Thomas. So basically, we were stuck in Miami for the night and were booked on the first flight (8:30 am) the next morning. We were offered a hotel voucher at a cheap airport hotel; which was a far cry from the beach front resort that we had purchased (priced by the hotel at $620/night). My wife and I also had checked the bags with all of our clothes, so we didn't have a change of clothes until we reached our destination (St Thomas). On the next day we reached arrived at our gate early, but were told that our flight had been delayed due to weather and that we would be flying out 7 hours later. We later found out that this was a lie, and that really the cause for delay was that an emergency landing had been made on St Thomas' only landing strip, and that an hour and a half cleanup of the landing strip was required. All other airlines resumed flights within 2 hours. So, we spent another 7 hours in the airport waiting for our flight. All-in we spent 24 hours stuck in Miami without a change of clothes, most of it spent in the airport, when a 5-miute delay of one flight (that was on time) could have solved their own failure entirely. American Airlines' first attempt at compensation was to offer my wife and I 2500 aa points each. If you figure those points are worth about $0.01, then the total value of their compensation was $50 = 2 x 0.01 x 2500. After writing them an email explaining that I am prepared to take them to small claims court, they offered me and my wife each $100 travel vouchers. After I denied again, they offered us each $150 travel vouchers. After I denied again, they apologized but said there was no other offer. I also asked how much money American made on the sale of our seats, and they said the representative said he didn't know. Basically, American Airlines believes they are entitled to screw you over and doesn't care to compensate you for damages whatsoever. Not only that, everyone of their agents (rebooking/gate) are entitled and have a terrible attitude.

Wonderful hard product, for certain that is now fully competitive with what other airlines offer on International service. But the soft product (customer service, food, beverage, etc.) is now awful. From the check-in experience, to the lounges to the in-flight service, it feels like no one wants to work at the airline anymore or cares about customers.

The main course looked terrible and tasted worse. The pork was fatty, grey in colour and over salted, the rice congealed and the broccoli cold. The red wine was served ice cold. The decision to serve prosecco rather than French Champagne given the flight experience is targeting holiday makers is baffling. The only snacks available were potato crisps and crackers.

This fact was shared with us onboard, ""we're all real nervous about our benefits and seniority with the upcoming merger with Alaska Airlines"", (this explains the hostility directed at customers), direct from an attendant sitting beside me in a jump seat.

Imagine trying to sit in a plane for 10 hours, with the seat constantly shaking from turbulence, and no back support. My mother had to rely entirely on her core strength just to stay upright. It was physically exhausting and incredibly uncomfortable, leaving her with back pain after the flight. The flight attendants tried to fix the seat, but nothing worked. To make matters worse, a Korean-speaking flight attendant assured us we would be refunded for the broken seat, but after the flight, Hawaiian Airlines refused to offer any cash compensation. Instead, they gave us a useless travel voucher that expires in a year, despite us not having any travel plans within that time. It feels like the flight attendant deliberately lied to us just to avoid further complaints during the flight. This left us feeling deceived and extremely frustrated, adding insult to injury after such a terrible experience. Even worse, despite me being the one who suffered, they acted as if they were doing me a favor by throwing a voucher my way, which made the whole situation even more infuriating. Given the poor service, broken seat, and deceptive promises, I strongly advise against choosing Hawaiian Airlines, especially in business class. You’re paying for premium, but they’ll leave you with only frustration.",Negative
hawaiian airlines,"""I will no longer fly Hawaiian""","  I normally travel Hawaiian Airlines from Sydney Australia to Honolulu, flying in the main cabin but Comfort Plus and always had great experiences. Went to book today to find out that all the niceties related to Hawaiian have been removed. ie no more 2 suitcases and additional fees ($100+) if your bag is over 23kg, Not even blankets, even on an overnight flight and other small but important things to the traveler. I was always happy to pay the premium price to fly with this airline but after looking at the options, such as Jetstar, unfortunately I will no longer fly Hawaiian, even with the Jetstar add ons. Sad but true. Plus, they used to fly direct from Brisbane, which made a difference to us with me being disabled but again no more. I think Ozzie’s will end up waking up unfortunately after they book, thinking they had the same benefits but alas no more. ",Positive

Delta Air lines,"""incredible lead flight attendant"" ","   First the good. An incredible lead flight attendant who completely won us all over with his charm, his smile, and his efficiency. He did not disappear after the meal service but consistently checked up on us offering snacks and drinks.The meal was a pre order and ok. The insult is the seating configuration. The meager legroom should be an embarrassment to Delta. It is literally impossible for the window seater to get to the aisle without the aisle sitter getting up.When the seat in front is reclined minimally there is not an inch to spare and the screen is hard to see. Directly behind without a divider of any sort is a small premium economy section who sit there enviously staring at the minimal upgrade that first class is. Truly shameful. As I said previously the flight attendant was the saving grace.",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""my baggage was lost""","  After being forced to gate check my carryon item, my baggage was lost on a flight to Mexico City Saturday 2/15. I was told the bags would be delivered Sunday 2/16 after the bag was scheduled to arrive at 11:20 AM. Delta's ""Check Bag Status"" page said that my ""bag is set up for delivery at 3:53 PM"", I have received no communication (no phone call or email even though I had to waste my time after my flight filling out that information for Delta). I am preparing for my second day in foreign country without my baggage. Don't fly Delta/Aeromexico to Mexico City.",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""told I could not board the flight""","   I arrived at the airport and my flight was delayed. My Delta app notified me I could switch flights for free, so I did switch so that I could catch my second flight from Seattle to Redmond (My first flight was Boston to Seattle). This second flight was delayed, and my app notified me I could switch flights for free, and so I switched to my original flight from Boston to Seattle with a later flight from Seattle to Redmond. When my flight was finally ready for boarding (4 hours after expected time), I tried to scan my physical boarding pass and was told I could not board the flight. I figured this was just because I switched flights in the app, so I showed them my boarding pass in the app. They said I did not have an eticket (despite my app showing my itinerary) and that I would not be allowed to board. I asked to speak to a manager, and she told me since I didn't have an eticket I would not be on the flight, nor could I transfer to another flight or receive a refund. I showed them my original boarding pass, my flight receipt, my app boarding pass, my app itinerary, and my baggage status (showing my bags were on that flight) in the app. They let me watch my flight take off without me. I was able to book a flight with United later in the day and that flight went smoothly. I still have yet to see if my checked baggage makes it to Redmond, the Delta app says it's on the plane but who knows. 0/10 They didn't let me on my flight that I paid $350 for and they might lose my baggage.",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""forced to pay $600 for a new ticket""","   I arrive to TPA International to board my flight from Tampa to Las Vegas and the TSA airport security says that my date of birth with my booking reservation with Delta is wrong and it is 05/01/1997, but I talk to 4 delta representatives and they say that my birthdate with my booking reservation was correct and has not changed since I originally booked my flight. I miss my flight and I am forced to pay $600 for a new plane ticket because TSA makes me go through ID Verification and then I try to get a refund for my flight ticket and Delta says that their system is correct and my birthday was right the entire time. Both Delta and Tampa International both are just pointing fingers at each other and I am the one who has to front the $600 expense and both companies say it’s not their fault. Terrible customer service from each side and no one wants to take accountability and just default to “it’s our procedure” or the booking reservation has not changed from the beginning. Also the TSA Supervisor is condescending and tried to make it my fault and can’t even tell me why it’s coming up as incorrect if delta says it’s correct the entire time.",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""Worst first class ever""","   Flew first class, 6 hour flight cold cabin and no blankets available in first class. Unbelievable on cross country flight in first class, no blanket, no pillow, no amenities. Worst first class ever, don’t waste your money",Negative
Delta Air lines,“service taken superficially and impatiently”," As an experienced traveller I can tell that traveling with Delta is the worst experience. It starts with the ground staff who are very unfriendly, impatient and it clearly shows that they don’t enjoy their job. Following the airline crew, members feels like all mid aged to old women who passed their prime. Hence service is taken superficially and impatiently. No sense of customer service and friendliness. I will avoid Delta from now on.",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""Made me check a carry on""","  Give Delta a ""zero"". Made me check a carry on. I board and there's at least one empty overhead bin and space in other bins. 100% dissatisfied. I purposely did not check a bag so I wouldn't have to wait for my bag at baggage claim!",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""crew was absolutely amazing"" ",   I recently went on a girls trip for my birthday. The crew was absolutely amazing. They gave me a gift bag and the sweetest note ever. They were the BOS/MSP Crew. It was the best start to a trip of a lifetime. I don’t have all of their names but thank you Darren and Chelsea you are one in a million and really made me feel like a kid again by your special treatment. I had complete strangers telling me happy birthday through the whole airport! Thank you so much for your hospitality!,Positive
Delta Air lines,"""Delta cancelled their tickets""","   I bought two tickets for my friends. The payment went through, and I received a confirmation of the purchase of two tickets. Everything is fine. But imagine the surprise when we were told at the airport that the tickets were cancelled, and Delta sent me a refund. I did not request a refund, my bank (as I found out) did not reject the transaction. For some reason unknown to me, Delta decided to do this. And Delta did not notify anyone. And we get a situation - two people at the airport cannot fly, because they just found out that Delta cancelled their tickets.",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""Not a very good airline""",   Overbooked flight and allowed passengers carryon bags that boarded earlier to fill up all overhead bins such that the last third of the passengers had to check all carryon roller bags! Why can’t they only allow people to put their carryon bags overhead where they are sitting only? And overbooked the flight! Not a very good airline at all if they can’t control these simple things!,Positive
Delta Air lines,"""experience was the worst"" ","   My experience from Los Angeles to Atlanta yesterday was the worst! Bad consumer experience, Delta people treat you in a rude way, very stupid, screaming with people to organize queues. I had a problem with a flight attendent that was so aggressive on the way she was speaking, putting me in an embarassing situation. ",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""an absolute disaster""","   This is a mediocre airline masking chaos with spin. My recent flight experience with Delta was an absolute disaster. The flight was scheduled to leave at 5 PM, and we had already begun pre-boarding when they suddenly delayed it—due to “crew rotation issues solvable in 30 min”. That’s not just bad planning, that’s complete operational failure. Worse yet, Delta kept passengers in limbo by delaying the flight in 3–4 hour increments, rather than being honest about the scope of the issue. We didn’t end up departing until 3 AM—nearly 10 hours late. This wasn’t just an inconvenience; I missed an important business meeting in Seattle that cannot be rescheduled or salvaged. When I asked about meal vouchers, a check-in agent smugly claimed the delay was due to weather—a completely false excuse that he threw out without even checking the flight’s status. When I pressed him on it, he got defensive instead of just owning the mistake. Another agent eventually handed me a $45 voucher, which was frankly insulting considering the time and opportunities lost. Meanwhile, the ground crew was patronizing and dismissive, treating passengers like they were the problem for simply asking for updates. The lack of accountability was staggering. But here’s the real kicker: This isn’t just a one-off incident. Delta has clearly been in a state of decline. Flights are constantly delayed, crews are visibly irritated, customer service is unresponsive, and compensation is laughably inadequate. It’s also hard to ignore the pattern: Every quarter, especially in the last two weeks before it ends, Delta’s delays and cancellations seem to spike—and yet, minimal compensation is offered to retail passengers. It’s almost as if they’re gaming the system: delaying flights incrementally to avoid triggering certain metrics, and downplaying the chaos to maintain the illusion of operational performance. It feels calculated—like Delta is more concerned with managing optics and investor reports than actually serving its customers. This is not an isolated issue. It’s systemic. They lost me as a business.",Negative
Delta Air lines,"""Thank you to everyone"" ","  I recently flew to Utah for surgery and had some complications. I ended up on oxygen due to flu and altitude sickness. Delta changed my flight the first time because I was hospitalized and could not make my flight. They changed it a second time when the changed flight did not allow enough time on my lay-over to make my flight. They did not charge me money or points, and arrangements were made for a wheelchair, since I would be on oxygen to fly home. It went seamlessly. Thank you to everyone who made a very trying time less stressful. And PS, my first leg of my flight, a young pilot was deadheading to Atlanta and he helped me so much.",Positive
